# Python Library Challenge

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the use of four essential libraries for data science and web development: **NumPy**, **pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **requests**. The program completes a series of practical tasks to showcase the functionality of each library.

## **Task Breakdown**

The `library_challenge.py` script performs the following tasks:

1.  **NumPy**: Creates a NumPy array containing numbers from 1 to 10 and calculates its mean value.
2.  **Pandas**: Loads a small dictionary into a pandas DataFrame and then uses the `.describe()` method to display key summary statistics.
3.  **Requests**: Fetches data from a public API endpoint (`JSONPlaceholder`) and extracts a specific piece of information (the title of a post).
4.  **Matplotlib**: Generates a simple line graph, plotting `y = x^2` for values of x from 1 to 10. The graph is displayed in a new window.

## **How to Run the Program**

### **Prerequisites**

You must have Python installed, as well as the required libraries. If you don't have them, you can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib requests
